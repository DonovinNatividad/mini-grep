This is my mini grep coded in Rust
It allows for setting the environment variable IGNORE_CASE to 1 or 0 to search case sensitively or unsensitively respectively.
Given two cli arguments: subject and filepath, this program searches through the given textfile for the subject and outputs the
results in the terminal. It searches for a REGEX (Regular expression).
